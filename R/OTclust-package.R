#' Mean Partition and Uncertainty Assessment in Cluster Analysis by Optimal Transport Alignment(OTA)
#'
#' \pkg{OTclust} is an R package for computing a mean partition of an ensemble of clustering results by optimal transport alignment (OTA) and for assessing uncertainty at the levels of both partition and individual clusters. To measure uncertainty,  set relationships between clusters in multiple clustering results are revealed. Functions are provided to compute the Covering Point Set (CPS), Cluster Alignment and Points based (CAP) separability, and Wasserstein distance between partitions.
#' For a quick introduction to OTAcluster see the vignette A quick tour of \pkg{OTclust}.
