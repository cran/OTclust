Description: Providing mean partition for ensemble clustering by optimal transport alignment(OTA), uncertainty measures for both partition-wise and cluster-wise assessment and multiple visualization functions to show uncertainty, for instance, membership heat map and plot of covering point set. A partition refers to an overall clustering result.
